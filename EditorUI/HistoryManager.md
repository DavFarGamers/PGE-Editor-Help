# History Manager

This editor records all actions in a history manager. You can undo and redo action you made.
Currently only the level editor supports the History Manager.


<Note type="tip">
NOTE: Don't rely on the History Manager. Because this editor is a
work in progress, it can always be that some actions aren't recorded
yet. You should always make a backup of your current level file!

<p><strong>World map</strong> - is an interactive list of levels which available 
to player(s) for play.</p>
<p>World map - is a key unit of game or episode!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>World map also can be a hub-styled, I.e. world map will not be used. Instead 
of world map you will use the special level, which called as hub. In the hub 
player can enter into levels though warps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start make world map, first of all you need open the "File" -&gt; "New" -&gt; 
"World" menuitem. When you did it you will see the main editing interface which 
contains editing space where you will need to place objects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to edit exist level, you can open the "File" -&gt; "Open" menu and 
select necessary file in the explorer. You also can drag&amp;drop file into editor's 
window directly to open them. You also can associate all supported by PGE Editor 
files with editor in the "Tools" -&gt; "Application Settings" menu.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To make world map you need to place any items which you can found in the 
special item toolbox. The world map also settings of your episode.</p>
<p>The important items are levels and paths. Levels are entrances of your 
levels. Paths giving able to walk between levels or walk over world map. Don't 
forget, paths are not connectable images, there are simple squares which giving 
abel to walk between them when they near to each other.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Each world map should have:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Title of episode</strong> - this is a name of world map which 
	showing in the main menu. If you will not define it and when you will try to 
	play it in the SMBX, you will see the blank title of episode!</li>
	<li><strong>Game start point</strong> - The any level item with "Game start" 
	flag. If you will not plase it, the player will start game from 0x0 
	coordinates of world map. If you will put multiple levels with "Game start" 
	flag, you will start game from oldest of them.</li>
	<li><strong>All levels should be connected with paths</strong> - if you will 
	don't connect levels with paths you will not be able walk over world map. 
	Path items - alone type of items which giving able to walk over world map. 
	Even if you will build chain of levels which placed together, next level 
	will be opened only if you will successfully complete it (level is 
	successful only if player end them by getting of exit item. If player lose 
	(killed by enemy/boss, fall down into pit, lose level mission, etc), exit is 
	failed and you should replay level)!</li>
</ul>

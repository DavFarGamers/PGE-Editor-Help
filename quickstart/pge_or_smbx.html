<p>First of all:</p>

Visual Basic 6 and working on Windows PC. First version was out in 2009'th year 
and development was stopped in 2011'th year. SMBX uses united application for a 
game engine and editing system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PGE</strong> - is a full featured game engine written in C++ which 
based on researched tech stuff of SMBX engine and fully compatible with them: 
you can open and save it's levels, worlds and othe stuff. With SMBX64 
standardized configuration packaged is able to play original SMBX levels and 
episodes!</p>
<p>PGE started in edge between 2013 and 2014'th years. PGE have multiple 
components: editor, engine and additional helpful tools. PGE is new and more 
progressive system than original SMBX Engine. In development process was solved 
already exists in the original SMBX problems and issues which was in them. PGE 
Editor have support of more features, more faster, flexible and universal.</p>

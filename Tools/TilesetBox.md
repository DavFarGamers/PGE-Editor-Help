It is a good additional feature to regular item toolbox:

necessary item by name or by ID. Also, with them you can place any items, even secret and super-secret.
- tileset item box is more convenient for create combinations of similar tiles and more visually, this is the best 
choice for use a compound item, (like ground tiles with slopes). You can create own tilesets for your custom 
graphics which will be saved in the episode or level specific folder.

_A Platform Game Engine by Wohlstand_

_This project is distributed under [GNU GNLv3](../license.html)._


**So what exactly is this?** This is an free and open source game engine and
toolkit which giving able to create games of platform genre.

The main and important idea of project - to give possible for any user
to creating platform games from exists media which you have or which
you can draw yourself. This idea I found in the SMBX fan game,
but main deficiency of SMBX is a strict data standard and closing
to the Mario fan game series.

Engine is going to be 100% compatible with SMBX. The main parts
it would contain would be a (SMBX compatible) game engine and a
tool-kit for creating games.

I've been working on this project since at least December 2013, 
and after lots of hours spent in researching SMBX 1.3, I've 
figured out a way to retain compatibility with SMBX. This in 
my opinion, is very significant as there are a lot of episodes 
and levels made for SMBX out there. And having a better program 
that can open/play/save in the SMBX64 format is very much in need.




## History


In December 2013 I had a desire to create [SMBX](WhatIsSMBX.md)-compatible
game engine, and in doing so, give it a new life. The game that inspired me is
called [Hedgewars](http://hedgewars.org/), a clone of the game
"Worms" by the company Team17. I decided to create a new game engine,
with the source code open under the GPLv3 License.

One of the most important parts of this project in my opinion is the
NAME. Because of the NAME of his project, Redigit came to grief with
Nintendo. Therefore, the engine which I will publish will not be
named after "Mario", and the new name will be a replacement to this.
However, the engine will be fully compatible with SMBX, meaning it
IS possible to use SMBX files with my engine.

For the project I decided to use [Qt](http://qt.io) and
[SDL libraries](http://libsdl.org) with C++. I want to make the engine
cross-platform: for Windows, GNU/Linux, and Mac OS. The project will
live if it is libre, open source.


**The Project is Currently Under Construction**, as of now, the editor
is currently available as a standalone application. All sources are
published on the GitHub repository.



Development of a game engine requires much responsibility and hard
work, therefore sufficient time and motivation is necessary for this
goal to be achieved.

and worlds convetient, fast, progressive and qualitative!

Moondust Editor - is a part of developing Moondust game engine project 
which based on SMBX64 standard - a tech stuff of SMBX Engine. 
Moondust going to be successof of old SMBX Engine to give more 
freedom of customization and giving able use it more useful for 
creation of any platform games!

_Moondust Editor designed to have most of features in the menus and on the
toolbar:_ you can switch between sections - separated sub-areas or rooms;
place player's start/spawn point, take placing of physical environments
(water, quicksand); lock or unlock items of target type to keep them in

settings of items, section, etc. Also you can copy selected items or
paste them from clipboard back. PGE Editor have a status bar where
you can see some difference messages. When you will work with items
on the level and on the world map, to have access to their properties
you have the context menu to use. \[**[Context menu](../../Editing/ContextMenu)** is a useful menu
with settings and features which can be opened by right (or left for
lefthander mouse) mouse button click\].

Moondust Editor has the advanced tools in the "Tools" menu where you
can find variouse graphics and audio converters, fixing and cleanup
wizards which will help you to fix errors in the presented stuff. 

Unlike original SMBX Editor, Moondust Editor uses multi-selection
concept which gives ability to work with multiple items at same time.
Instead of each item dragging to change their properties, you have
able use a context menu. You also have able to set same properties
to multiple items at one! You can copy, you can paste your stuff
into another level/world, you can undo any junk changes (and redo
them too). With placing mode you have useful features like line,
rectangle, flood-fill which help you place items more convenient.
With "Overwrite mode" you can even replace items on the map
without pre-deleting of them!


<u>PGE Editor unlike original SMBX have no bugs which was in the SMBX before:</u>

- you have full freedom with using of decimal values in the npc.txt files
(they are opens freely and safely)
- you have full freedom to use custom sceneries in range 32-65 on the world
map with correct saving of file (SMBX crashing when you try to save
world map with those items).

- you will don't flood with vines or with sceneries when you try
to put them to map.

- flood-fill is safe, if you was accidental flooded outer space,
flood-filling process will be aborted after 3 sec. which will give
you able undo it and fix your wrongs without re-opening of editor.

- you will never get "overflow" message because PGE Editor have
more space to hold your items. If you try to save level or world
into SMBX format, you will be noticed about exiding of it's limit
which giving you able remove junk items to take able open your
level in the SMBX correctly.

If you don't like regular item box with categories and filter
search, you have able use **Tileset Item Box** which giving you
tileset box which more similar to original SMBX toolbox, but
you have special "Custom" tab where you have able to make
your own tilesets!
